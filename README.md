# GC content Calculator
GC content is usually calculated as a percentage value and sometimes called G+C ratio or GC-ratio.

## Why to care about GC Content?
* The GC pair is bound by three hydrogen bonds, while AT pairs are bound by two hydrogen bonds. And so, 
* The GC content affects the stability of DNA. 
* The GC content affects the secondary structure of mRNA. 
* The GC content affects the annealing temperature for template DNA in PCR experiments.

## Where to apply the GC Content?
The GC Content can be used in 
* primer design for PCR experiments 
* gene design from protein expression 
* mRNA hairpin prediction and etc.

## Usage
'''bash
to use this tool, just type 'python GC_content_calc.py /path/to/fasta/file'

## Example
I have provided an example file of SRY Gene in the test folder. use this file to test the script for better understanding.
